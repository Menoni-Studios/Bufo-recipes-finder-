This is an Ionic mobile application that: 
• reads recipe data from the internet (Spoonacular.com) 
• allows a search for recipes by ingredients 
• allows viewing of full recipe details (ingredients, instructions) 
• maintains a favourite recipes list 
• allows measurement units to be shown in either US or Metric.


Solving issues in the render of the Details Page( that uses the recipe ID to call the second API endpoint and renders the full recipe information, including the image, a list of ingredients with amounts and units, and instructions with numbered steps).
